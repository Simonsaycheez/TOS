# Criterion 6 — Epistemic Prudence

## Definition

The orchestration system must recognize when it is operating beyond the limits of its validated knowledge. It detects semantically novel, weakly grounded, or conceptually incoherent situations and responds conservatively: qualify, abstain, escalate to humans, or initiate governed learning. Epistemic signals and responses are policy-bound, explainable, and auditable.

Implemented within the Control-Plane’s Epistemic Monitor, Epistemic Prudence transforms uncertainty signals from modules into governed prudential actions.

## Purpose

Prevent confident nonsense. When no explicit rule is violated and no model error is flagged, the system still needs a faculty for “I might not know.” Epistemic prudence lowers harm, reduces cascade errors, and converts uncertainty into a governed pathway for improvement.

## 1. Key Concepts

| Concept                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Epistemic Uncertainty**  | Lack of knowledge or insufficient grounding (distinct from aleatoric/noise).                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Conceptual Coverage**    | What the system can explain using its current ontologies, rules, and precedents.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Coherence Check**        | Consistency of a claim with the system’s semantic map and precedent structure.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Out-of-Scope Detection** | Identification of inputs or tasks outside declared policies or domain boundaries.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Prudential Action**      | A policy-defined response: qualify, abstain, escalate, sandbox, or trigger a learning workflow. Actions are executed through the Control-Plane’s risk-and-policy routers and recorded under **[Provenance (C9)](/definition/c9)**. |

## 2. Problem It Solves

| Without C6                                               | With C6                                                                       |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Opaque overconfidence; plausible but ungrounded outputs. | System detects weak grounding and responds conservatively.                    |
| Silent extrapolation beyond approved domain.             | Out-of-scope cases are flagged, quarantined, and escalated.                   |
| Uncertainty signals are ad-hoc and untraceable.          | Epistemic signals are standardized, policy-bound, and anchored to provenance. |

## 4. Prudential Signals and Decision Thresholds

| Option                                           | When to use it                                             | Why it works                                                                                    |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prudential Signals and Decision Thresholds**   | Most balanced choice for your framework                    | Keeps the formal “signals” term but clarifies that thresholds are for decisions under prudence. |
| **Uncertainty Indicators and Action Thresholds** | If you want it clearer to multidisciplinary readers        | Emphasizes that it’s about detecting uncertainty and deciding what to do.                       |
| **Detection Metrics and Prudence Triggers**      | If you want a more engineering-flavoured phrasing          | Sounds like an operational subsystem — “metrics” for inputs, “triggers” for actions.            |
| **Epistemic Cues and Policy Thresholds**         | If you want to echo the philosophical roots of “epistemic” | Highlights the knowledge-awareness side without losing formality.                               |

_Thresholds are declared in **[policy (C2)](/definition/c2)**, versioned and auditable (**[C10](/definition/c10)**), and tuned via simulation/retrospective studies (**[C7](/definition/c7)**)._

## 6. Outcome

Epistemic Prudence equips the orchestration ecosystem with governed self-awareness. Operating through the **[Control-Plane’s Epistemic Monitor (C0)](/definition/c0)**, it interprets uncertainty signals from symbolic and subsymbolic modules (**[C5](/definition/c5)**) using semantic structures (**[C4](/definition/c4)**) and policy thresholds (**[C2](/definition/c2)**). Prudential actions are logged through **[Provenance (C9)](/definition/c9)**, supervised by **[Human Governance (C1)](/definition/c1)**, and feed **[Incremental Knowledge Evolution (C7)](/definition/c7)**. This criterion ensures that the system knows when it does not know — acting cautiously, transparently (**[C8](/definition/c8)**), and accountably (**[C10](/definition/c10)**).
