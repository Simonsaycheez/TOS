# Criterion 2 — Policy-Enforced Operation

## Definition

Every AI module and workflow in the orchestration ecosystem must execute under **explicit, machine-readable policies** that define permissible actions, safety limits, ethical constraints, and procedural conditions.

_Policies are declared, bound to each execution step, enforced during reasoning, and verified after completion; continuing updates to minimise enforcement latency are provided under governance._

## Purpose

To make sure **rules and constraints are not advisory but executable**.

- This criterion turns governance principles — legal, ethical, and procedural — into **operational logic** that constrains and shapes the reasoning of every module.
- The goal: every AI act can prove that it obeyed a declared policy at runtime, not just that someone hoped it would.

## 1. Key Concepts

| Term                        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Declared Policy**         | A human-authored, machine-readable statement of how the system must behave (derived from laws, manuals, or institutional rules).                                                                |
| **Policy Binding**          | The runtime contract linking a declared policy to a specific task, module, or dataset. Binding includes validation of applicability and latency-tuned propagation to all participating modules. |
| **Policy Controls**         | Concrete enforcement rules (mask feature, threshold, HITL required, etc.).                                                                                                                      |
| **Policy Realization**      | The actual manifestation of those controls in computation — thresholds, feature masks, filters, prompt templates, rule activations.                                                             |
| **Policy Adaptation Cycle** | Continuous refinement of policy bindings and control parameters to minimise enforcement latency and maintain alignment with updating governance policies without performing containment itself. |

## 2. Two Enforcement Layers

These layers work together so that a policy is not only known but **operationally obeyed**.

| Layer                       | Description                                                                | Implemented by                              | Timing           |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :--------------- |
| **Declarative Enforcement** | Determines _what_ rules apply. Builds and signs the Policy Binding object. | **Policy & Governance Engine**              | Before reasoning |
| **Operational Enforcement** | Determines _how_ those rules affect the reasoning and outputs.             | **Knowledge Mediation Layer / Module SDKs** | During reasoning |

## 3. Operational Flow

A simplified flow demonstrating policy integration:

**Human / System Request**

↓

**Policy & Governance Engine**

- Identify applicable declared policies
- Produce Policy Binding (scope, controls, risk class)

↓

**Knowledge Mediation Layer**

- Translate controls into operational parameters
- Inject constraints into reasoning process

↓

**AI Module Execution**

- Runs under enforced parameters

↓

**Post-Validation**

- Verify outputs, rationale, and provenance against policy

↓

**Ledger & Monitoring**

- Anchor records
- Trigger alerts if violation detected
- Emit a violation signal to [C9](/definition/c9) for containment and reporting

## 4. Direct & Indirect Enforcement

| Mode                        | Description                                                                                     | Example                                                                                   |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Proactive (Instructive)** | Constraints embedded in prompts, parameters, or API payloads when module allows direct control. | Generates prompt with masking and citation rules.                                         |
| **Reactive (Evaluative)**   | If module is external/opaque, orchestration validates input/output afterward.                   | Evaluate returned text for Personally Identified Information (PII) and missing citations. |

> Either way, the same declared policy governs the action.

## 5. Policy Lifecycle

1.  **Authoring:** Knowledge engineers formalize human policies → Declared Policy.
2.  **Binding:** Policy Engine attaches to a request.
3.  **Execution:** Mediation layer enforces constraints in reasoning.
4.  **Validation:** Outputs checked and logged.
5.  **Evolution:** Policy versions managed and updated through governed lifecycle (**[C7](/definition/c7)**, **[C9](/definition/c9)**, **[C10](/definition/c10)**).

## 7. Outcome

Criterion 2 ensures that **policy is a live, computational entity** — not a PDF or a slide deck.

- Every reasoning step, from input through output, happens _within declared, enforced, and auditable constraints_.
- It transforms policy from _documentation_ into _runtime governance_.
