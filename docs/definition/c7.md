# Criterion 7 — Incremental Knowledge Evolution

## Definition

The orchestration system must evolve its symbolic rules, model parameters, and ontological mappings through governed, auditable, and incremental updates.

_Within the **[Control-Plane (C0)](/definition/c0)**, Incremental Knowledge Evolution governs the continuous improvement of symbolic rules, models, and ontologies under explicit **[policy (C2)](/definition/c2)**, **[human oversight (C1)](/definition/c1)**, and **[provenance anchoring (C9)](/definition/c9)**. It transforms learning into a predictable, auditable **[lifecycle (C10)](/definition/c10)** where evolution occurs only from validated evidence (**[C6](/definition/c6)**)._

## Purpose

To ensure that **improvement never equals unpredictability**.

- **Criterion 6** establishes the procedural backbone for safe evolution—how new data, rules, or models enter the system while keeping provenance, policy alignment, and explainability intact.
- It’s the safeguard against “silent drift” and “autonomous mutation.”

## 1. Key Concepts

| Concept                      | Description                                                                                                                         |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Knowledge Asset**          | Any policy, rule, model, ontology, or dataset version under orchestration governance.                                               |
| **Evolution Lifecycle**      | Standard workflow controlling updates to knowledge assets.                                                                          |
| **Change Proposal Envelope** | Structured request describing a proposed update, evidence, tests, and rollback plan.                                                |
| **Knowledge Patch**          | Small, versioned unit of change applied to the knowledge base or model; each patch must pass validation and audit.                  |
| **Evolution Ledger (C9)**    | Specialized **[ledger (C9)](/definition/c9)** recording provenance, approval chain, and rollback history of every accepted change.  |
| **Dual-Control Validation**  | Human–AI joint approval (**[C1](/definition/c1)**, **[C2](/definition/c2)**) before a patch becomes active.                         |
| **Version Anchoring**        | Cryptographic linkage of each approved change to **[provenance ledger (C9)](/definition/c9)** for auditability.                     |
| **Rollback Mechanism**       | Pre-defined restoration path to prior stable version if performance or compliance regress (**[C10](/definition/c10)**).             |
| **Rollback Commit**          | Automated reversion procedure tied to **[Lifecycle Accountability (C10)](/definition/c10)** in case of error or policy breach.      |
| **Governed Learning**        | Learning or retraining that occurs under explicit **[policy (C2)](/definition/c2)** and **[human oversight (C1)](/definition/c1)**. |

## 2. Problem It Solves

| Without C7                                                             | With C7                                                                                                  |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Models or rules drift silently; no one knows why results changed.      | Every change is proposed, validated, and approved with full provenance.                                  |
| Updates overwrite prior states; impossible to reproduce past behavior. | All versions preserved and revertible.                                                                   |
| AI “learns” from data without ethical or legal checks.                 | All learning governed by declared policies and human approval.                                           |
| Compliance broken by untracked model updates.                          | Policy binding and provenance enforced at every evolution stage.                                         |
| Uncertain discoveries vanish or accumulate unvalidated.                | Validated prudential events (**[C6](/definition/c6)**) become structured proposals for governed updates. |

## 6. Outcome

Incremental Knowledge Evolution ensures that **Orchestration AI learns responsibly**.

Every change is deliberate, documented, and reversible. No autonomous drift or silent model replacement occurs. Continuous improvement remains policy-anchored and human-supervised (**[C1](/definition/c1)**, **[C2](/definition/c2)**), with every update anchored in **[provenance (C9)](/definition/c9)** and **[lifecycle accountability (C10)](/definition/c10)**.
