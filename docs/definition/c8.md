# Criterion 8 — Transparency & Explainability

## Definition

Within the **[Control-Plane (C0)](/definition/c0)**, every operational or governance process must emit a **structured rationale envelope** explaining _what_, _why_, and _under which policy context_ an action occurred. Transparency reveals; explainability interprets. Both apply to runtime decisions and system evolution, ensuring every behaviour remains auditable under **[provenance (C9)](/definition/c9)** and **[lifecycle accountability (C10)](/definition/c10)**.

## Purpose

To convert orchestration from a “black-box assembly” into a _glass-box ecosystem_ where meaning, justification, and provenance travel together.

- Transparency exposes **what** happened; explainability conveys **why** it happened.
- It converts trust into a continuous, evidence-based property: every inference and every update is explainable, traceable, and reversible.

## 1. Transparency Modes and Scope

Transparency operates through two operational paths:

- **Execution Transparency (Normal Operation):** Generates a **Decision Envelope** explaining the rationale and evidence for runtime decisions.
- **Evolution Transparency (Governance Operation):** Generates a **Change Envelope** documenting the rationale and evidence for updates, policy revisions, or ontology modifications.

Both paths use the same semantic, policy, and provenance infrastructure (**[C4](/definition/c4)**, **[C9](/definition/c9)**, **[C10](/definition/c10)**) and are expressed as flow diagrams later in this criterion.

## 2. Key Concepts

| Concept                              | Description                                                                                                                |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structured Rationale**             | Machine-readable explanation of a decision: claim, evidence, uncertainty, and policy context.                              |
| **Explainability Policy**            | Declares who can access which fields of an explanation and at what granularity (implemented via **[C2](/definition/c2)**). |
| **Change Proposal Envelope (CPE)**   | Structured explanation of a modification: what changed, why, validation evidence, approvals.                               |
| **Traceability Chain**               | End-to-end linkage from input → reasoning → output → policy → provenance.                                                  |
| **Controlled Rendering (CNL / CSL)** | Explanations convertible to both human-readable and machine-verifiable forms.                                              |
| **Transparency Continuum**           | The unified framework joining execution transparency (decisions) and evolution transparency (system changes).              |

## 3. Problem It Solves

| Without C8                                              | With C8                                                                               |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Black-box results; no rationale or lineage.             | Every decision and change includes verifiable explanations.                           |
| Impossible to contest or review.                        | HITL reviewers can trace, interpret, and override.                                    |
| System evolves silently; no accountability for updates. | Every modification produces a logged Change Envelope and audit trail.                 |
| Regulators cannot verify compliance.                    | **[Provenance ledger (C9)](/definition/c9)** links each event to policy and evidence. |

## 4. Operational Flow

Here are the two operational flows for transparency:

#### A. Normal Operation (Execution Transparency)

**Module executes reasoning**

↓

**Explanation Generator → Decision Envelope**

↓

**Policy context + evidence + uncertainty attached**

↓

**Envelope validated → [Provenance Ledger (C9)](/definition/c9)**

↓

**HITL Console renders CNL summary for human review**

#### B. Maintenance Operation (Evolution Transparency)

**Change trigger detected (drift / new policy)**

↓

**Governance team submits Change [Proposal Envelope (C7)](/definition/c7)**

↓

**Validation & simulation tests executed ([C7](/definition/c7))**

↓

**Dual-control approval ([C1](/definition/c1))**

↓

**Deployment → Ledger anchoring ([C9](/definition/c9)) → Monitoring ([C10](/definition/c10))**

## 6. Outcome

**[Criterion 9](/definition/c9)** for provenance makes **transparency systemic, not optional**. Transparency & Explainability ensure that Orchestration AI never hides its reasoning nor evolves in silence. Execution Transparency answers _“What did it do and why?”_; Evolution Transparency answers _“How did it change and under what authority?”_ Together they guarantee interpretability and accountability under human-defined **[policy (C2)](/definition/c2)**, **[immutable provenance (C9)](/definition/c9)**, and **[lifecycle control (C10)](/definition/c10)**.

## Supplemental Note — Relationship between Criterion 2 and Criterion 8

[Criterion 8](/definition/c8) extends the concept of transparency across the **entire policy lifecycle**, distinguishing it from [Criterion 2](/definition/c2), which governs only **policy-enforced operations** during normal execution.

### 1. Temporal Distinction

- **[Criterion 2 – Policy-Enforced Operation](/definition/c2)** applies policies _in real time_ while the system performs reasoning or decision tasks. It ensures that every action is constrained by declared rules, thresholds, and ethical limits.
- **[Criterion 8 – Transparency & Explainability](/definition/c8)** governs the _meta-level_ processes that document and communicate **how policies were applied, reviewed, or updated**. It ensures that both operational decisions and subsequent policy changes are explainable and traceable.

### 2. Functional Relationship

| Phase                                                      | Primary Criterion        | Objective                                                                    |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operational** (normal reasoning)                         | **[C2](/definition/c2)** | Enforce current policies on live tasks.                                      |
| **Governance / Maintenance** (policy or knowledge updates) | **[C8](/definition/c8)** | Explain, justify, and record how those policies or knowledge assets evolved. |

- **[Criterion 2](/definition/c2)** _uses_ existing policies; **[Criterion 8](/definition/c8)** _explains and evolves_ those policies under transparent governance.

### 3. Feedback Loop

- **[C2](/definition/c2)** executes reasoning under declared policy and produces Decision Envelopes as proof of compliance.
- **C8** collects those explanations, reviews system behaviour, and—when necessary—initiates or documents policy updates through Change Envelopes.
- The updated policy returns to **[C2](/definition/c2)** for enforcement in subsequent operations.

This establishes a continuous, auditable loop between **operational policy use** and **governance transparency**.

### 4. Architectural Context

Within the **[Control Plane (C0)](/definition/c0)**:

- **[C2](/definition/c2)** operates mainly in the _Execution & Mediation_ layer.
- **[C8](/definition/c8)** operates primarily in the _Governance & Lifecycle_ layer, ensuring maintenance transparency.

Both rely on **[Criterion 9 (Immutable Provenance)](/definition/c9)** to secure their records and make all explanations tamper-evident.

### 5. Essence

**[C2](/definition/c2)** applies policy; **[C8](/definition/c8)** explains and evolves it. Together they ensure that Orchestration AI is both _lawful in action_ and _accountable in evolution_.
