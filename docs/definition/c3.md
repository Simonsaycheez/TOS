# Criterion 3 — Interoperable Modularity

## Definition

All AI components in the orchestration ecosystem must be **composable, replaceable, and independently testable** through standardized interfaces, semantic schemas, and policy bindings.

_Each module operates as a governed capability, not a monolithic subsystem, enabling continuous evolution under policy control._

## Purpose

To ensure that Orchestration AI remains extensible, maintainable, and certifiable across heterogeneous technologies and life cycles.

Interoperable modularity prevents technical and governance lock-in by treating every AI capability — model, rule engine, database, or human interface — as a **certified, exchangeable component** within the orchestration constitution.

## 1. Key Concepts

| Concept                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Module**                      | Any computational or human-assisted capability participating in orchestration (LLM, rule engine, database, external API, or human-in-the-loop process).                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Capability Registry**         | Catalog of all approved modules, including metadata, interfaces, policies, and provenance.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Interface Contract**          | Declares input/output schema, ontology mapping, security, and policy constraints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Module Wrapper**              | Control-plane layer that enforces policy, semantic validation, and provenance for each module (**[Criterion 0](/definition/c0)**). Implemented through the Control-Plane’s Semantic Interface Adapter and Policy Binder, ensuring compliance with **[C4](/definition/c4)** and **[C2](/definition/c2)**. |
| **Trust Tier**                  | Classification of module reliability: trusted, sandboxed, restricted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Plug-and-Prove Architecture** | Principle that any module can be replaced or upgraded without breaking orchestration, provided it satisfies interface and policy contracts.                                                                                                                                                              |

## 2. Problem It Solves

| Without C3                                                  | With C3                                                                      |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Monolithic AI stacks; integration requires rewriting logic. | Every module speaks through standardized semantic and policy interfaces.     |
| Impossible to certify or replace models independently.      | Each module version is certifiable and exchangeable under the same criteria. |
| Vendor or technology lock-in.                               | Any compliant module can substitute, regardless of vendor or method.         |
| Fragmented compliance (rules differ by subsystem).          | Policy bindings and provenance standardized system-wide.                     |

## 3. Operational Flow

**Developer submits module for registration**

↓

**Capability Registry evaluates metadata, I/O schema, ontology links**

↓

**Policy Engine attaches applicable policies**

↓

**Wrapper Generator (Creates enforcement layer (policy, semantic, provenance) for each module.) builds control interfaces (pre/post validators)**

↓

**Certification Service (Verifies module compliance with declared policies and schemas.) runs compliance tests**

↓

**Module receives Capability ID and trust tier**

↓

**Module integrated into orchestration (semantic + policy aware)**

_At runtime, communications among modules always pass through the control-plane wrappers, ensuring stable interoperability._

## 4. Forms of Modularity

| Form                      | Description                                                        | Example                                       |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Functional Modularity** | Each capability performs a single governed function.               | Risk predictor, summarizer, policy auditor.   |
| **Technical Modularity**  | Modules use open protocols (e.g., REST, gRPC, semantic envelopes). | Replaceable APIs with shared schema.          |
| **Semantic Modularity**   | Shared ontology ensures meaning consistency.                       | “Patient risk” = same term across all models. |
| **Policy Modularity**     | Each module’s behavior governed by its declared policy bindings.   | Module-specific safety and data policies.     |

## 5. Relation to Other Criteria

| Related Criterion                                                       | Relationship                                                                  |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[C0 — Control Plane](/definition/c0)**                                | Provides registry, wrappers, certification, and enforcement mechanisms.       |

| **[C4 — Semantic Communication Integrity](/definition/c4)**             | Shared language ensures module interoperability.                              |
| **[C5 — Symbolic–Subsymbolic Integration](/definition/c5)**             | Allows hybrid modules to coexist within common schema.                        |
| **[C6 — Epistemic Prudence](/definition/c6)**                           | Monitors interoperability gaps or undefined behaviours between modules.       |
| **[C7 — Incremental Knowledge Evolution](/definition/c7)**              | Enables safe updates or replacements without losing governance history.       |

## 6. Topological Variants

| Architecture                   | Description                                                                                        |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Centralized Control Plane**  | Registry and certification managed by a central authority.                                         |
| **Federated Orchestration**    | Multiple organizations share policy and ontology standards but manage their own module registries. |
| **Edge / Distributed Control** | Lightweight wrappers embedded within modules but synchronized via semantic protocols.              |

_All maintain the same interface and policy discipline._

## 7. Outcome

Criterion 5 guarantees that Orchestration AI can **evolve safely**:

- Modules can be added, removed, or replaced without breaking trust.
- Governance stays consistent across vendors and technologies.
- Certification, rollback, and provenance remain traceable.

**Interoperable Modularity** transforms Orchestration AI from a static architecture into a **living ecosystem** — where every component is autonomous in function but unified in semantics, policy, and accountability.
