# Criterion 0 — Control-Plane (Orchestration Capability Existence)

## Definition

A **control-plane mechanism** must exist—centralized or distributed—to continuously enforce semantic, policy, and provenance integrity across all modules in the orchestration ecosystem.

_It acts as the constitutional “war room” that operationalizes and coordinates the **Ten Criteria** in real time._

## Purpose

To guarantee that governance, transparency, and policy enforcement are not conceptual promises but **active system functions**.

**Criterion 0** affirms that the orchestration framework has a verifiable governance fabric capable of:

- managing registered modules,
- mediating all communications,
- enforcing declared policies, and
- proving compliance through immutable provenance.

Without this layer, the Ten Criteria cannot be instantiated or sustained.

## 1. Core Functions of the Control Plane

| Function                                      | Description                                                                                                                            |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Capability Registration & Certification**   | Registers modules (symbolic, subsymbolic, human, or external), validates metadata, assigns trust tier, and binds applicable policies.  |
| **Policy Execution and Constraint Injection** | Applies **[Criterion 2](/definition/c2)** controls—binding, thresholds, masks, HITLrequirements—before any module executes.            |
| **Semantic Communication Governance**         | Ensures all inter-module communication passes through validated semantic envelopes (**[Criterion 3](/definition/c3)**).                |
| **Knowledge Mediation & Translation**         | Implements symbolic–subsymbolic mapping (**[Criterion 5](/definition/c5)**); wraps black-box or third-party models.                    |
| **Audit & Provenance Anchoring**              | Hashes every binding, execution, and output into an immutable ledger (**[Criterion 9](/definition/c9)**).                              |
| **Observability & Risk Containment**          | Monitors runtime behavior, detects drift or anomalies, triggers rollback (**[Criterion 9](/definition/c9)**).                          |
| **Lifecycle Management**                      | Version-controls all modules, rules, and policies; manages deployment, rollback, and retirement (**[Criterion 10](/definition/c10)**). |

## 2. Operational Flow

**Module registration → Policy mapping → Certification**

↓

**Request arrives → Policy Engine binds applicable policies**

↓

**Semantic Adapter validates message structure**

↓

**Knowledge Mediation applies constraints / translations**

↓

**Module executes (black-box or open)**

↓

**Post-validation → Provenance anchoring → Monitoring**

The control plane governs before, during, and after every reasoning act.

## 3. Topological Options

| Model                         | Description                                                                               | Typical Use                                          |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Centralized Control Plane** | Single supervisory subsystem for the entire orchestration environment.                    | High-assurance, regulated sectors (health, defense). |
| **Distributed Control Plane** | Lightweight orchestration agents embedded in modules but coordinated by shared protocols. | Scalable, cloud or industrial ecosystems.            |

_Both are valid as long as **semantic, policy, and provenance coherence** are maintained._

## 4. Assurance Evidence

To prove Criterion 0 compliance, an implementation must demonstrate:

| Evidence Type                 | Description                                                                                       |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Operational existence**     | Running control-plane services with APIs for registration, policy binding, mediation, and audit.  |
| **Interface documentation**   | Standardized message schema, ontology references, and policy-binding APIs.                        |
| **Test reports**              | Logs showing schema validation, policy injection, and provenance anchoring for live transactions. |
| **Separation of duties**      | Distinct credentials for policy authors, deployers, and auditors.                                 |
| **Uptime & coverage metrics** | % of executions under control-plane supervision (target = 100%).                                  |

## 5. Relation to the Ten Criteria

**Criterion 0** is therefore the **enabling environment** for Criteria 1–10.

| Criterion                                                               | Relationship                                                                               |

| **[C4 — Semantic Communication Integrity](/definition/c4)**             | Enforces envelope validation and ontology alignment.                                       |
| **[C5 — Symbolic–Subsymbolic Integration](/definition/c5)**             | Hosts the mediation layer bridging reasoning styles.                                       |

| **[C10 — Lifecycle Accountability](/definition/c10)**                   | Maintains full history and rollback plans for every artifact.                              |

## 6. Example (Conceptual)

A new third-party model is registered:

- Control plane evaluates its risk class, attaches applicable policies, generates a wrapper with semantic adapters and validators.
- During runtime, every call to that model passes through constraint enforcement and semantic validation.
- Outputs are symbolically translated, logged, and anchored in provenance.
- HITL console displays compliance summary for review.

Without changing the model itself, the control plane guarantees that **its behavior remains within orchestrated governance**.

## 7. Outcome

**Criterion 0** certifies that **Trustworthy Orchestration AI has an active orchestration brain** — a control-plane capability that is:

- **Continuous** — operates during every reasoning cycle,
- **Comprehensive** — covers all modules and messages,
- **Configurable** — supports centralized or distributed implementations,
- **Provable** — offers audit logs and compliance evidence.

**Criterion 0** turns the Ten Criteria from theory into a living system: it is the _engine room_ that makes trustworthiness operational, not aspirational.

## Supplemental Note 1 — Nature of the Control Plane

The Control Plane is **not, by default, an AI system**. It is an **intelligent governance infrastructure** whose primary purpose is to _enforce, coordinate, and audit_ the Ten Criteria across all modules in the orchestration ecosystem.

While it may include AI-based utilities, its essential character is **deterministic, symbolic, and procedural**.

It executes human-authored governance logic rather than engaging in autonomous reasoning or decision-making.

### 1. Default Composition

Built from rule engines, workflow managers, semantic validators, and provenance services.It executes policies through explicit control logic rather than model inference, functioning as the **constitutional system** for the orchestration environment.

### 2. Permissible AI Assistance (Optional)

AI methods may support the control plane in narrow, well-governed roles:

| Subsystem          | Possible AI Use                                                  | Governance Guardrail                                                 |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Risk Monitor       | Drift and anomaly detection                                      | Must report alerts; cannot self-correct silently                     |
| Policy Matcher     | Natural-language or embedding search to locate relevant policies | Final binding verified by rule logic                                 |
| Semantic Mediator  | LLMs to propose ontology alignments                              | Human or rule validation required                                    |
| Adaptive Optimizer | Workflow optimization or resource allocation                     | Subject to dual-control approval (**[Criterion 1](/definition/c1)**) |

All such AI assistance remains _bounded, explainable,_ and _reversible_ within the declared policies.

### 3. What It Is Not

- Not an autonomous “super-AI” controlling others.

- Not a self-learning agent beyond governed adaptation ([Criterion 6](/definition/c6)).

- Not a replacement for human authority ([Criterion 1](/definition/c1) ensures human oversight).

### 4. Functional Identity

The Control Plane is a **meta-computational governance system**, not a cognitive system. It may _use_ AI, but it does not _become_ AI; it _governs_ AI.
