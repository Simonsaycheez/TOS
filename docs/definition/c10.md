# Criterion 10 — Lifecycle Accountability

## Definition

Within the **[Control-Plane (C0)](/definition/c0)**, Lifecycle Accountability guarantees that every artefact—decision, policy, rule, model, or dataset — remains **traceable, reversible, and certifiable** throughout its lifespan.

_It operationalises accountability by binding **[provenance (C9)](/definition/c9)**, **[human oversight (C1)](/definition/c1)**, and **[policy enforcement (C2)](/definition/c2)** into a continuous version-controlled record that enables safe rollback, audit, and retirement._

## Purpose

To make **time itself part of governance**.

- Lifecycle Accountability ensures that every element of the orchestration system — its knowledge, models, and policies — remains explainable not only at the moment of action but across its entire existence.
- It turns transparency into durability: trust that endures change, hand-offs, and decay.

## 1. Key Concepts

| Concept                                          | Description                                                                                                |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Version Ledger**                               | Time-sequenced registry of all approved artefacts with lineage and expiry metadata.                        |
| **Certification Envelope**                       | Structured record confirming that a version passed validation, audit, and policy checks before activation. |
| **Rollback Commit**                              | Logged procedure for reverting to a certified previous state under governed control.                       |
| **Deprecation Protocol**                         | Policy-bound retirement of outdated artefacts while retaining audit trace.                                 |
| **Lifecycle Manager ([C0](/definition/c0))**     | Control-Plane component coordinating versioning, rollback, and archival; implements **Criterion 10**.      |
| **Accountability Policy ([C2](/definition/c2))** | Defines who approves lifecycle transitions and how evidence must be retained.                              |

## 2. Standard Lifecycle States

| Without C10                                                 | With C10                                              |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| Versions of rules, models, and policies drift or disappear. | Every change linked to a certified lineage record.    |
| Errors fixed ad hoc with no rollback proof.                 | All restorations governed and logged.                 |
| No institutional memory; accountability ends at runtime.    | Permanent audit trail connects all historical states. |
| Decommissioned assets vanish without trace.                 | Retired versions preserved under controlled archival. |

## 3. Operational Flow

**New or updated artefact proposed (rule, model, policy)**

↓

**Lifecycle Manager ([C0](/definition/c0)) creates Certification Envelope**

↓

**Policy Engine ([C2](/definition/c2)) validates compliance and triggers human co-approval (C1)**

↓

**Version Ledger ([C9](/definition/c9)) anchors certification record and lineage hash**

↓

**Artefact deployed → active version state**

↓

**Observability / Provenance monitoring ([C9](/definition/c9)) detects performance or compliance drift**

↓

**If rollback required → Lifecycle Manager executes Rollback Commit**

↓

**Deprecation Protocol archives retired version; Transparency Layer ([C8](/definition/c8)) publishes closure report**

## 4. Forms of Accountability

| Form                           | Description                                                              | Example                                            |
| :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operational Accountability** | Runtime traceability of decisions to responsible components or humans.   | “Decision ID → approved by AI Safety Officer.”     |
| **Version Accountability**     | Each model or rule tagged with version, certification, and lineage hash. | “RiskPredictor v4 → certified 2025-04-01.”         |
| **Corrective Accountability**  | Verified record of rollback or remediation.                              | “Rollback Commit RC-2025-22 executed after drift.” |
| **Retirement Accountability**  | Controlled decommissioning with preserved audit trail.                   | “Policy POL-CLIN-2023 → deprecated 2025-06-30.”    |

_No orphaned assets. If nobody owns it, it doesn’t run._

## 5. Relation to Other Criteria

| Criterion                                                               | Interaction                                                      |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[C0 — Control-Plane](/definition/c0)**                                | Hosts Lifecycle Manager and coordinates all version transitions. |
| **[C1 — Human Governance](/definition/c1)**                             | Approves and certifies lifecycle events.                         |
| **[C2 — Policy-Enforced Operation](/definition/c2)**                    | Provides Accountability Policy and rollback permissions.         |
| **[C4 — Semantic Communication Integrity](/definition/c4)**             | Ensures lifecycle metadata uses standard ontology terms.         |
| **[C6 — Epistemic Prudence](/definition/c6)**                           | Supplies signals prompting rollback or revision.                 |
| **[C7 — Incremental Knowledge Evolution](/definition/c7)**              | Receives certified updates and integrates them safely.           |
| **[C8 — Transparency & Explainability](/definition/c8)**                | Publishes lifecycle summaries and reports.                       |
| **[C9 — Provenance, Observability & Risk Containment](/definition/c9)** | Anchors certification and rollback records.                      |

## 6. Outcome

Lifecycle Accountability closes the orchestration loop.

- It guarantees that no decision, model, or policy exists outside verifiable lineage or beyond human recall.
- Every state is **traceable ([C9](/definition/c9)), reversible ([C0](/definition/c0) via Lifecycle Manager)**, and **re-certifiable ([C1](/definition/c1) & [C2](/definition/c2))**.

With **Criterion 10**, Orchestration AI achieves **institutional memory**—the capacity to remember, correct, and prove every evolution of itself.
