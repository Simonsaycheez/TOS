# Criterion 9 — Provenance, Observability & Risk Containment

## Definition

Within the **[Control-Plane (C0)](/definition/c0)**, every data flow, decision, and policy update must be **anchored, monitored, and governed through a continuous assurance fabric** that guarantees the integrity of records and the stability of behaviour over time.

This fabric operates through **immutable provenance and real-time observability**, enabling the system to detect violations and execute governed containment actions when required.

_Provenance secures what has happened; observability ensures that what continues to happen remains safe, compliant, and accountable._

## Purpose

To sustain trust dynamically — not merely by recording events, but by **continuously verifying** that the orchestration behaves as declared and recovering safely when it does not.

**Criterion 9** fuses proof-of-truth (immutability) with proof-of-safety (observability) so that every reasoning act, adaptation, or drift event is verifiable, monitorable, and correctable under policy.

## 1. Key Concepts

| Concept                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Immutable Provenance**                | Cryptographic record of every decision, update, or policy change—tamper-evident, timestamped, and signed.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Observability**                       | Continuous monitoring of telemetry, semantic envelopes, and model behaviour to detect drift, anomalies, or violations.                                                                                                                              |
| **Signal Bridge**                       | Interface that channels prudence alerts from **[Criterion 6 (Epistemic Prudence)](/definition/c6)** into the **[Control-Plane (C0)](/definition/c0)** to trigger risk assessment and containment workflows.                                         |
| **Knowledge-Gap Recovery Loop**         | Coordinated process: Detection → Risk Calculation → Short-Term Containment → Long-Term Evolution. It operationalises **Criterion 9** by linking Observability, Risk Containment, and Rule-Maintenance Feedback into a single governed reflex cycle. |
| **Risk Containment**                    | Governed mitigation actions—pause, rollback, retrain, or HITL review — executed when observed risk exceeds policy thresholds defined under **[Criterion 2](/definition/c2)**.                                                                       |
| **Incident Assurance**                  | Logging and anchoring of every alert, response, and resolution in the provenance ledger for full accountability.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Rule-Maintenance Feedback**           | Output of incident or containment analysis feeding into **[Criterion 7 (Incremental Knowledge Evolution)](/definition/c7)** to update rules, ontologies, or model parameters.                                                                       |
| **Knowledge Assurance Dashboard (KAD)** | **[Control-Plane (C0)](/definition/c0)** coordination workspace combining automated analytics and human oversight for real-time containment, recovery, and decision approval.                                                                       |
| **Recovery Latency**                    | Measured interval between detection of a knowledge problem and certified deployment of its validated fix — key performance metric of agentic responsiveness.                                                                                        |

| Without C9                                                        | With C9                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logs exist but can be edited or lost; behaviour drifts unnoticed. | Records are immutable, continuously monitored, and cryptographically secured.                                                                                                                                |
| Provenance provides static history but no active vigilance.       | Provenance, observability, and prudence signals integrate for live assurance.                                                                                                                                |
| Policy violations discovered only after harm.                     | Risk signals trigger governed containment through the **Knowledge-Gap Recovery Loop**.                                                                                                                       |
| System forgets incidents after resolution.                        | Every incident and response anchored in a single lineage chain for audit and learning.                                                                                                                       |
| Knowledge gaps remain unaddressed or fixed ad hoc.                | **C9** initiates the **Knowledge-Gap Recovery Loop**—detecting problems, calculating risk, applying short-term containment, and routing validated cases to **[C7](/definition/c7)** for long-term evolution. |

_Note: This extension establishes **C9** as the operational mechanism for real-time knowledge assurance, transforming provenance from passive record-keeping into an active, self-correcting governance loop._

## 6. Outcome

**Criterion 9** ensures that trust in Orchestration AI is **continuous, reflexive, and auditable**.

- It integrates detection, containment, and learning into a single governed process anchored in provenance.
- Every anomaly triggers a measurable reflex — _detect → assess → contain → evolve → certify → report_ — closing the knowledge gap between problem and correction.
- Through the **Knowledge Assurance Dashboard**, humans remain in command of each step, while the system maintains uninterrupted safety, traceability, and improvement.

Provenance, Observability & Risk Containment thus operate as the **epistemic reflex centre** of Orchestration AI—proving what has happened, ensuring what is happening remains safe, and guaranteeing that what will happen next is better informed and fully governed.
