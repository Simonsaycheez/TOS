# Criterion 4 — Semantic Communication Integrity

## Definition

All interactions among orchestration modules must occur through **structured, validated, and ontology-grounded symbolic messages**. All interactions among orchestration modules must occur through structured, validated, and ontology-grounded symbolic messages governed by the **[Control-Plane (C0)](/definition/c0)**.

_Each exchange must preserve meaning, context, uncertainty, and provenance so that both humans and AI modules can interpret it consistently._

## Purpose

To guarantee **shared understanding and traceable meaning** across every part of the orchestration ecosystem.

- When multiple AIs, rules, and humans cooperate, they must communicate through a **common semantic language** that eliminates ambiguity and makes reasoning auditable.
- [**Criterion 3**](/definition/c3) creates that language layer.

## 1. Key Concepts

| Concept                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Semantic Envelope**                  | The formal container for any inter-module message (Decision, Knowledge Update, Audit). Contains claims, evidence, rationale, uncertainty, and provenance validated by the **Symbolic Interface Adapter (SIA)** to ensure compliance with declared ontologies (**[C4](/definition/c4)**) and policies (**[C2](/definition/c2)**).                                              |
| **Ontology Grounding**                 | Every concept or field in the envelope is linked to a defined vocabulary or ontology term (e.g., SNOMED, ISO codes, custom domain graph).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Schema Validation**                  | Messages must conform to a declared structure (JSON-LD, RDF, SHACL). Invalid messages are rejected or quarantined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Provenance Header**                  | Carries trace ID, parent ID, signatures, and hash digests to maintain audit lineage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Controlled Semantic Language (CSL)** | The restricted vocabulary and grammar used for machine-to-machine communication. It’s a _controlled language_ at the semantic — not natural — level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Controlled Natural Language (CNL)**  | Human or LLM-produced natural language used in orchestration contexts must be constrained by a policy-declared Controlled Natural Language schema. Each human utterance or LLM-generated text is parsed into a semantic envelope whose fields map to ontology terms, policies, and provenance IDs, ensuring the same level of interpretability as machine-to-machine message. |

## 2. Problem It Solves

| Without Criterion 3                                                                                | With Criterion 3                                                           |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modules emit arbitrary JSONs, free-text, or embeddings that each consumer must guess how to parse. | Every message follows a governed schema; meaning is explicit and testable. |
| Confidence values, units, and tags are inconsistent.                                               | All values are typed and linked to ontology terms with known semantics.    |
| Humans cannot trace where an inference came from.                                                  | Each claim is linked to evidence URIs and cryptographic provenance.        |

## 3. Operational Flow

**Module A (raw output)**

↓

**Symbolic Interface Adapter (SIA)**

- Parse & normalize
- Validate schema
- Ground ontology terms
- Add provenance + policy context

↓

**Validated Semantic Envelope → signed & anchored**

↓

**Shared Bus / Recipient Modules / HITL**

↓

**Recipient SIA verifies & decodes**

_If validation fails → quarantine + alert → human review._

## 4. Types of Envelopes

| Type                          | Purpose                                             | Core Fields                                                         |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Decision Envelope**         | Encapsulates a model or rule inference.             | `claims`, `evidence`, `uncertainty`, `policy_context`, `signatures` |
| **Knowledge Update Envelope** | Represents proposed knowledge or model changes.     | `changes`, `evidence`, `tests`, `approver`, `rollback_plan`         |
| **Audit Envelope**            | Carries results of compliance or validation checks. | `rule_id`, `result`, `evidence`, `confidence`, `timestamp`          |

_All inherit common metadata: `trace_id`, `module_id`, `version`, `ontology_ref`, `hash`._

## 5. Human Interaction vs Machine Language

| Layer                 | Language                                                                | Role                                         |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Human (HITL)**      | Natural language (explained via LLM and driven by Controlled Language). | Express intent, approve, understand results. |
| **Machine (Modules)** | Controlled Semantic Language (CSL).                                     | Execute reasoning and enforce policy.        |

_The LLM acts as interpreter between the two: converts human input ↔ semantic envelope. This translation relies on policy-bound mediation (**[C2](/definition/c2)**) and symbolic reasoning (**[C5](/definition/c5)**) to maintain epistemic coherence (**[C6](/definition/c6)**)._

## 6. Relation to Other Criteria

| Related Criterion                                                       | Relationship                                                                           |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[C0 — Control-Plane](/definition/c0)**                                | Hosts the SIA services and enforces message validation at runtime.                     |
| **[C1 — Human Governance](/definition/c1)**                             | Humans see policy explanations and can review structured envelopes through HITL tools. |
| **[C2 — Policy-Enforced Operation](/definition/c2)**                    | Policies reference envelope fields; enforcement relies on consistent semantics.        |
| **[C3 — Interoperable Modularity](/definition/c3)**                     | Provides standardized schema contracts that define envelope structure.                 |
| **[C5 — Symbolic–Subsymbolic Integration](/definition/c5)**             | The SIA converts subsymbolic model outputs into symbolic envelopes.                    |
| **[C6 — Epistemic Prudence](/definition/c6)**                           | Monitors envelope coherence to flag uncertain or undefined semantics.                  |
| **[C8 — Transparency & Explainability](/definition/c8)**                | The envelope’s rationale + evidence create structured explanations.                    |
| **[C9 — Provenance, Observability & Risk Containment](/definition/c9)** | Provenance headers and hashes tie each message to the ledger.                          |
| **[C10 — Lifecycle Accountability](/definition/c10)**                   | Versioned schemas and ontologies maintain long-term interpretability.                  |

## 7. Outcome

Semantic Communication Integrity ensures every module, human, or auditor communicates through a **Controlled Semantic Language** governed by the **[Control-Plane (C0)](/definition/c0)**, validated by **[policy (C2)](/definition/c2)**, and anchored in **[provenance (C9)](/definition/c9)**.

Human and LLM natural language interactions are mediated through a **Controlled Natural Language** layer governed by the **[Control-Plane (C0)](/definition/c0)**. This ensures that all human inputs and AI explanations remain semantically explicit, machine-interpretable, and consistent with the orchestration ontology.
